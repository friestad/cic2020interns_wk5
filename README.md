# cic2020interns_wk5 - PoC Sprint 1

## Scenario
Throughout the year, IBM CIC Baton Rouge conducts career fairs where candidates and employers are provided a chance to meet one another, establish professional relationships, and discuss potential job and/or internship opportunities. Normally, the center uses a custom app which manages the recruitment process but due to COVID-19, the center has pulled back from in-person interviewing, amid mushrooming infections worldwide, and is resorting to virtual events. You are tasked with developing a solution that incorporates the use of breakout sessions in Webex with the existing recruitment app.

This effort uses 3 Agile teams of full stack app devs. Scrum Team 1 is responsible for the Candidates API and Team 2, the Breakout Rooms API. **You are on Scrum Team 3 which owns the Queue Manager API.**

## User Story 
 > As a queue cop, I want to utilize a system that will allow me to manage the flow of candidates between breakout rooms (queues) so that candidates are interviewed by professional teams knowledgeable in the skills for the candidate’s potential JRSS
